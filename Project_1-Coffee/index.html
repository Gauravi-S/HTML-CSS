    <h2>House Blend Coffee</h2>

    <p>
        House Blend coffee is unique to every coffee shop, every roaster, and every drinker.That is what
        <br/>makes them so unique and so special. The blending and serving process is built entirely on
        <br/> the preference of the roaster and/or distributor. For example, Starbucks describes their House Blend as
        <br/> “the very first blend we ever created for you back in 1971. The one blend that set the course for the way
        <br/>our master blenders and roasters work even today. A true reflection of us and delicious cup of coffee, period.”

    <p>
        French Toast flavored coffee has a sweet flavor and aroma of golden maple syrup and cinnamon.
        <br/>French toast is made by frying a piece of bread soaked in a egg batter. French toast was developed as a 
        <br/>way to use day-old stale bread. Toasting your bread lightly can help it absorb more of the egg and milk batter. 
        <br/>French toast is usually served with toppings similar to those used for pancakes, waffles, and toast.

    <h2>Columbian Roast</h2>
    <img src="./images/columbian.jpg"  alt="columbian">
    <p>
        Colombian coffee also has a dark roast used to make rich espresso blends. Remember that the roast of the coffee
        <br/> isn’t actually related to the growth of the coffee. Colombia is famous for its coffee beans, which can be used to make 
        <br/>both light roasts and dark roasts. Now, the richer and flowery flavor of Colombian coffee beans does make them especially 
        <br>suited for a dark roast, but light roasts made from Colombian beans are also amazing.

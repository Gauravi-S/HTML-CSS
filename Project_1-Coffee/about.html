        The Coffee junkie is open in Westchase! We are excited to introduce our Coffee Shop & Cafe.If you crave great 
        <br/>coffee, you’ll love knowing that we provide a real alternative to chains with handcrafted coffee and espresso drinks, 
        <br/>a full tea bar, and real food options.“We grind for you”… our local baristas know that great espresso takes more than 
        <br/>pushing a button. We work hard to deliver great taste while also providing knowledgeable service, perfect if you 
        <br/>just want to try something new.Our Cafe delivers way beyond the traditional coffee shop favorites (although we think our 
        <br/>homemade pastries are pretty good). We have traditional breakfast choices, including eggs and pancakes, and plenty of 
        <br/>healthy options (including gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan). Our lunch offerings include a wide variety of salads,  
        <br/>sandwiches and flatbreads. And as for the late nighters… we know you’ll appreciate having a spot for your dessert fix as 
        <br/>well as a spiked coffee.And as a final quick intro to “us”- the owners: we are Westchase residents (no franchise or 
        <br/>corporate owners in sight). Our first Grind, The Campus Grind, opened a few years ago at USF St Pete and has provided us 
        <br/>with real world experience to make sure The Grind at Westchase can actually deliver what we promise- a great coffee shop/cafe experience.
        <br/>If you’re looking for something a little rustic yet lovely, this is it. Tucked away in Bandra, this place is a reminder of the 
        <br/>old Mumbai with its glorious heritage. With an old school vibe, they serve amazing coffee.Our favourite is the Vietnamese 
        <br/>Coffee. They also have an amazing patisserie section, which you need to taste.
